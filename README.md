# Differential Equation Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) System Mapper

This program considers the discrete-time LTI system characterized by the following differenceequation with input and initial conditions specified:
y[n]-3y[n-1]+2y[n-2] =x[n], with y[0] = 1 and y[1] =-1,x[n] = (1/2)^n*u[n-2]

A MATLAB program was written to simulate this differential equation, and to  plot the values of the input signal, x[n] and the output signal, y[n] over the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10.
